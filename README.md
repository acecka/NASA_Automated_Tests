**NASA Automated Tests**

This project has been created as a Diploma Project for ALK Postgraduate Studies on 'Selenium Test Automation' major. NASA Automated Tests is written in Python / Selenium, using Page Object Pattern approach.


**Scope Summary**

The project focuses on Automating functional tests on the NASA.gov webpage. As this is an official agency's website, the scope of tests had to be limited - avoiding any impact on the site, even with NASA's friendly approach to learning. 
Tests in this repository focus on UI verification, ensuring all Navigation is correct and the pages it leads to are functional.


**Future Plans for the Project**

In the future I plan to expand the tests to cover the NASA+ page - which consists of videos and other media, as well as tests on their API's - which are kindly provided by NASA for learning purposes.



**How to run?**

To run the tests, simply use the Executor file - which will not only run all available tests but also generate a raport using an existing HTML Test runner library.
